# "Python words searcher"
Q: "How many words can you think of with 7 letters (each word consists of 7 letters. No more and no less), if you can use only the letters ABCDEFGHIK and in each word all letters must be unique, that is, one word cannot have two identical letters?"

We going to use python and my laptop rtx videocard for this search in datasets.

# Stack:

Python, tensorflow


# Dataset:

Inside 'dataset' folder we have a 12 txt files with different english vocabularies, what perfectly simulates taks, when you have different data about same topic.
